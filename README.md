# Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project leverages **deep learning** to detect and classify brain tumors from MRI scans. The model can classify images into **three types of brain tumors (Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary)** as well as **Normal (No Tumor)**. The system is designed to assist medical professionals by providing **fast, accurate, and interpretable predictions**.
